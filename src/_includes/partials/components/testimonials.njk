    <p class="quotation">Terry is one of the most reliable developers I've worked with. His attention to detail makes him much faster than other developers and his sense of responsibility is the core of his manner and attitude. <br /><br />His speciality is front end but he superbly manages breaking tasks and working with backend developers. Terry also put a lot of effort to help and upskill junior developers. I worked with Terry on various projects for about a year and I would love to work with him again.</p>

    <p class="quotation">I worked with Terry on the launch of web tools within the Private Banking area at RBS. Terry reviewed the business and operational requirements needed to develop an appropriate solution tailored to Private customersâ€™ needs. <br /> <br />This solution could be developed and updated in-house saving the project both time and money. His ability to resolve complex problems in constantly changing environments, and his can-do attitude, made him a pleasure to work with.</p>
