<p class="text-500 sm:text-600">I'm an experienced front end developer and consultant, based in Bristol, UK. I have 15 years of commercial experience working with well-known brands such as <strong>NatWest</strong>, <strong>RBS</strong>, <strong>Royal London</strong>, <strong>RAC</strong>, and the <strong>University of Bristol</strong>.</p>
<p>
I've also worked on projects with several digital agencies such as <strong>McCann</strong>, <strong>EMO Unlimited</strong>, and <strong>Oakwood Media</strong>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrtobrien" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Connect with me on LinkedIn</a> to read over 10 recommendations/testimonials from these companies.</p>

<h2>Keeping up to date</h2>

I <strong>regularly attend various events and conferences</strong> to keep up with current goings-on in the web industry. Bristol has many tech meetups which I'd recommend, including Bristol SEO, Bristol Wordpress People, Bristol JS, SWUX - South West User Experience, and Bristol Inclusive Design and Development. I also enjoy the yearly Pixel Pioneers conference.

Outside of my focus of web development, I also <strong>learn more about the broader industry</strong>, including user experience, digital marketing, business and entrepreneurship via books, courses and podcasts. I also attend conferences further afield such as SXSW Interactive in Austin, Texas. I'm also an active member of <strong>Bristol Media</strong> which is one of the largest creative networks in the UK. I take this additional knowledge and use it to build websites that work effectively for my clients and their customers.

<p>I am the <strong>founder of Red Spark Digital Ltd</strong>, which is a web consultancy based in Bristol working with clients across the UK.

<h2>Purpose of this website</h2>

<strong>Here on my personal website, I will be writing articles primarily focused on web development and web optimisation</strong>. I wish to help others in my sector to improve their development practices and show ways to optimise websites to ensure they work effectively.

Soon I will also be <strong>offering workshops and courses</strong> in a range of topics where your business can either hire me to come and teach your employees or take online courses remotely in your own time. To hear more about this, sign up to my <a href="https://mailchi.mp/877e42635e8c/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newsletter</a>, you'll be first to know.

<h2>The personal bit</h2>

When I'm not doing the above, I spend time with my wife and two young children. When not standing on Lego littered around the house, we enjoy going on adventures (when there isn't a global pandemic). <strong>I enjoy crisps</strong>, I probably eat too many, but they are so damn tasty.

I'm friendly, <strong>say hello, drop me a message</strong> either via <a href="https://twitter.com/digitaltob" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@digitaltob on Twitter</a> or via the <a href="/contact">contact page</a>.
