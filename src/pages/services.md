<h2>Web Accessibility</h2>
<p class="text-600">A considerable number of websites are not accessible. The <strong>UK has approximately 13.9 million disabled people</strong>, according to the charity <a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/media/disability-facts-figures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scope</a>.  A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanrobinson/2019/09/25/website-accessibility-online-business/#171a47239c19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> in 2016 suggested <strong>71% of users with disabilities would leave a website that is not accessible</strong>. A portion of your users could be left frustrated, attempting to navigate and use your website. </p>

<h2>Web Performance</h2>
<p class="text-600">Page speed affects <strong>traffic</strong>, <strong>bounce rate</strong>, <strong>conversions</strong>, <strong>search rankings</strong>, <strong>bandwidth</strong> and even the <strong>environment</strong>. Making your website faster is crucial to improve in those areas, and when you do, you will reap the benefits.</p>

<h2>Technical SEO</h2>
<p class="text-600">There is a common saying within SEO circles "Content is king". While <strong>great content will help</strong> your search rankings, it is <strong>only one factor in how you rank in search</strong>.</p>

<img class="img-icon" src="/images/icons/icon-monitoring.svg" alt="Monitoring logo" width="150" height="150">
</div>
<div class="four-container">
<p>I've already highlighted above in the web performance section that <strong>page speed is a ranking factor</strong>. Search engines like Google want to crawl, and index pages on your website but <strong>poor site structure</strong>, <strong>broken pages</strong> and <strong>other key factors</strong> will <strong>harm your rankings</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Technical SEO</strong> can be the final step in your SEO puzzle (it needs to be part of a more comprehensive SEO strategy), but working with a <strong>developer who understands SEO</strong> on a technical level will <strong>add value to your SEO strategy</strong>.</p>

<p>Let's have a chat about your situation and see if technical SEO can help you.</p>

<h2>Consultancy</h2>

<p class="text-600">I am used to working with companies and their existing development and marketing teams to help build and improve their online offering. <strong>I still offer this as a more in-depth service</strong> in addition to the separate specialised services above.</p> 

If you are looking for this sort of support in a larger team, especially when it is a complex application, <strong>my skills roughly match a Front End Developer</strong> role covering HTML, CSS and Javascript, but <strong>with a clear focus on UI</strong> (User Interface). 

It is <strong>important to highlight this focus on UI</strong>, as the term 'Front End Developer' can cover a wide range of skills and technologies these days. More recently, <strong>I have seen job descriptions for this role type with the skills heavily skewed to javascript frameworks</strong> such as React and Angular (with the focus on SPAs - single page applications) <strong>with little regard on the HTML, CSS, Responsive Design and Accessibility</strong>. 

<strong>The skills required to be a 'Front End Developer' today are significant</strong>. If you want the job done correctly, especially when frameworks like React and Angular are involved, you need advanced knowledge across the different areas of Front End Development. <strong>I prefer to see this role split out as two - a UI Developer and a Javascript Developer</strong>. People in these separate roles can <strong>focus on being specialists rather than generalists</strong>.

<strong>So from a consultancy point of view, working with larger teams on <u>complex</u> applications, I am best as a UI Developer</strong> who works with designers to bring their designs to life as webpages using HTML and CSS (factoring in responsive design, accessibility and web performance).  I then work with Javascript developers (who focus on the likes of React and Angular) to integrate their advanced Javascript functionality into the HTML code. There is an interesting article called <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Great Divide</a> to explain the issues with the role title 'Front End Developer' on CSS Tricks. 

Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrtobrien" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a> to see <strong>verified recommendations/testimonials</strong> from clients who have used me in a consultancy capacity.
